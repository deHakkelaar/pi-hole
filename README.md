Hi Dehakkelaar
Because you have no email posted in your blocklist, and I can not open an issue on your repo, the only way I could think to contact you was from here

I am reporting an invalid domain on your blocklist:
www.academyofexperts.org:443

Because of the :443, this is not a valid domain for a hostsfile/Pihole
Can you please remove this line
